Objective: The goal of this project is to assume that an employee file has been created in an obsolete system. The program reads in the file, process the text to be more standardized, create an object for each person with corrections from the user, and output each person’s information. Each persons attribute has requirements to be met such as:
	1)  modify last name and first name to be in Capital Case, if necessary
	2)  modify middle initial to be a single upper case letter, if necessary. Use ‘X’ as a middle initial if one is missing
	3)  modify id if necessary, using regex. The id should be 2 letters followed by 4 digits. If an id is not in the correct format, output an error message, and allow the user to re-enter a valid ID
	4)  modify phone number, if necessary, to be in form 999-999-9999. Use regex.

Platform : macOS
IDE: PyCharm

To Run: place the input file in a folder named data within the same folder as your Python program. Specify the relative path ‘data/data.csv’ in a sysarg. 


Input: The input file (data.csv) looks like this. Last,First,Middle Initial,ID,Office phone 
						  Smith,Smitty,S,WH1234,5557771212 
						  WILLIAMS,WITTY,W,S4454,555-877.4321 
						  Luka,Luka,L,OF4321,555.888.3456 
						  jason,jake,,WH409,555 777 2094 
					          Krishna,krishna,k,SA9384,555 888 0093

Output
Employee list:
Employee id: WH1234 Smitty S Smith
555-777-1212
Employee id: SA4454 Witty W Williams
555-877-4321
Employee id: OF4321 Luka L Luka
555-888-3456
Employee id: WH5409 Jake X Jason 555-777-2094
Employee id: SA9384 Krishna K Krishna
555-888-0093

Side note:
From my personal experience, I don’t believe that python3 has any weaknesses for Text processing. Having the ability to import modules and use API’s makes the task easier. There were may things I’ve learned from this assignment; such as, using different data structures, basic file I/o operations, maneuvering in PyCharm, debug in a new environment, and many  other basic introductory operations.  I enjoyed this assignment and hope to learn many other techniques used in Natural Language Processing.
