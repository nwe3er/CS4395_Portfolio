# CS4395_Portfolio
This is a sample portfolio for CS 4395 (Human Language Technologies) 


## Introduction to Natural Language Processing
This assignment contains an introduction summarizing historical and current approaches to NLP and my personal interest in NLP.

Here is the document [Document](Overview_of_NLP.pdf)


## Text Processing with Python
This program reads in a file, process the text to be more standardized as described below, creates an object for each person with corrections from the user, and output each person’s information.

## Ngrams
This project creates bigram and unigram dictionaries for English, French, and Italian using the provided training data where the key is the unigram or bigram text and the value is the count of that unigram or bigram in the data. Then for the test data, calculate probabilities for each language and compare against the true labels.

[Task](Ngrams.pdf) [report](N-grams_report.pdf)

Input file for Program1: 
1. [English Training file](LangId.train.English) 
2. [French Training file](LangId.train.French) 
3. [Italian Training file](LangId.train.French)

Output file for Program1: 
1. [English Pickle unigram](English_unigram_dict.p) [English Pickle bigram](English_bigram_dict.p)
2. [French Pickle unigram](French_unigram_dict.p) [French Pickle bigram](French_bigram_dict.p)
3. [Italian Pickle unigram](Italian_unigram_dict.p) [Italian Pickle bigram](Italian_bigram_dict.p)


Input file for program2: 
1. [Test data](LangId.sol)

Output file for Program2: 
1. [My accuracy](highestProbability)
